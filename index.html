            <h4>Experience</h4>
            <p>
              I volunteered in a nursing home when I was in high school. And we
              took a lot of fruit to visit the old people in the nursing home,
              and then we chatted with the old people together. Finally, we were
              responsible for cleaning the nursing home.Then I worked as a
              librarian in the library. I am in charge of helping guests who are
              having trouble finding books. And I also need to tidy up my books
              before I leave work. Finally, I was responsible for the
              cashier.Finally, I went to a hotpot restaurant as a waiter in
              charge. I need to manage and assign waiters' work on a daily basis
              and ensure that it is done to the standard of the restaurant. I
              also need to serve and solicit guests.These work experiences have
              made me patient, passionate, and know how to effectively manage
              distribution.

            <h4>Teaching</h4>
            <p>
              When I was in high school I taught my cousin high school chemistry
              organic chemistry and ion concentration equations.In the summer
              vacation of high school, I taught my cousin English and chemistry
              in the third grade. As I won the second prize in the national
              chemistry competition, I was sometimes asked by the teacher to
              give chemistry lessons.I used to be a swimming coach at a swimming
              pool to teach kids how to swim. I once won the second place in the
              youth group of the swimming competition in Handan City.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>My opinion</h4>
            <p>
              In fact, you find that I am good at science. And my language
              ability is not very good. I also know clearly that my language
              expression ability and language learning ability are not good.
              Therefore, I think I need to choose English education major in
              order to overcome my weaknesses and make myself more perfect. Only
              in this way can I better teach the knowledge and thinking I have
              learned to students, and more people can understand my thinking.
              Moreover,I think my value is reflected in my experience and
              learning. I have worked in the service industry, so I think I have
              good manners and patience, and I often do physical exercises,
              which also makes me have a tenacious will, and also makes me have
              a positive and brave personality to face difficulties.

        <h4>Future</h4>
        In the future, I hope to achieve academic results through my own
        teaching ideas and methods, and to change the modern education system
        and philosophy through successful practice.In the future, I need to be
        able to persuade and educate students through each other's hearts.I know
        there will be many setbacks along the way. Because an event is risky and
        difficult. I will go down the road even if it is difficult, because I
        have chosen the path and I will do my best to do it. Finally I have
        ambition and passion to make academic achievements in my future teaching
        field.
